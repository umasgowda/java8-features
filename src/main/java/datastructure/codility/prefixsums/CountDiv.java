 * Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].
 * Example 1:
 * For A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.
 * Example 2:
 * For A=10, B=10 and K=2, your function should return 2
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
 * K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
 * A â‰¤ B.
